# ApprioApp

ApprioApp is a web-based application that enables users to perform **association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm**, helping discover meaningful patterns in transaction-like datasets and visualize the results.

## üöÄ Features

- **Support & Confidence Thresholds**: Set minimum support and confidence to filter frequent itemsets and generate strong association rules.  
- **Apriori Implementation**: Efficient bottom‚Äëup algorithm that generates k‚Äëitemsets iteratively based on the Apriori property :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Rule Output**: Presents rules in the form `X ‚áí Y` along with support, confidence, and lift metrics.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: View generated rules and optionally visualize them for easy interpretation (e.g. via tables or charts).  
- **Extensible Backend**: Built using [Your stack here], allows integration with real-world transactional datasets.

## üß† Background: What Is Association Rule Mining?

Association rule mining uncovers interesting relationships (e.g. itemsets often bought together) in large datasets. The Apriori algorithm‚Äîintroduced by Agrawal & Srikant in 1994‚Äîfinds frequent itemsets and assembles them into implication rules such as:
{bread, butter} ‚áí {milk}

meaning customers who buy bread & butter often also buy milk. It relies on the principle that all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Support measures how often an itemset occurs; confidence ranks how often an item Y appears given X; lift measures dependence beyond random chance :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
